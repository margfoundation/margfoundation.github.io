<h1>SACHIN DEV MOGHA</h1>
<p> I am a social worker and problem solver.  my thinking:- in Life stumbles us many times but it decides on us whether we have to stand up and move forward or stay there.
	So we must learn from our mistakes and our past. <br>
	 why i connected from Marg foundation because The joy that comes from helping others is the real joy
If there is a feeling of happiness by doing something, then there is no greater joy in it than that. The joy cannot be expressed in words. We serve or help others and he is pleased, the happiness that comes from him is bliss. 
     </p>

<h1>MEHAK DEWAN</h1>
<p>There is a special joy to learn that others benefitted because you have lived. It starts with your own family and extends to your community through social motivations.Self serving, it makes me feel better to know that I have helped others. Somewhat altruistic because life is better when triumphs are shared and the community gains from everyones happiness. The most recent sociological research suggests that the real key to producing better work is to find intrinsic motivation inside of yourself. Every person can become a responsible global citizen who can contribute in saving our planet.</p>

<h1>KUNDAN VERMA</h1>
<p>Life can never be dull or mundane once you have placed your foot upon this spiritual path because it sets life in motion and nothing remains static. The new will be able to unfold all around you and within you in true freedom and perfection. Are you satisfied to go along in the same old way? You are free to do so, but do not expect anything very uplifting to happen in your life if that is your choice. You cannot expect big changes to take place; you cannot expect to be used by Me to help bring down the new heaven and new earth. Those souls who choose to go their own way must be willing to accept the consequences, but those souls who are willing to do My will and walk in My ways usher in the New Age. Why wait until tomorrow to make your choice? Choose now</p>
