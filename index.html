<h1 class="title">Cow Protection through History</h1>
<p>All through our history, the rulers and role models of this country have protected and nurtured the cow. King Prithu, after whom the earth is called ‘prithvi’, milked a cow, which is the embodiment of earth, to end the famine on the planet and save humanity. Lord Krishna was a Gopal, cow herder. Arjun thought it worthy to risk another 14 years of exile in order to protect the cattle in Viratnagar war. King Nahush had to reimburse the fishermen with a prize equivalent to life of Rishi Chyawan, he did so by gifting them a cow. Chola King Manu Needhi Cholan killed his son Veedhividangan to provide justice to a cow whose calf was killed under the wheels of his son's chariot.</p>

<h1 class="title">Birth of 'Save a Cow'</h1>
<p>Cow is the favourite of Lord Shiv, it is said that whatever one whispers in the ears of a bull is heard by Lord Shiv and service to cow is given the highest place in the Vedas.

On the night of Shivratri (February 2012), two sadhikas on their way to Dhyan Ashram became witness to a hit and run case - the 'hit' was a three month old calf, and 'run' was an SUV driver who hit it; a pandit who was getting late for puja and a few dozen onlookers. Not one, save these two ladies, stopped to aid the calf. The calf was rushed to a reputed care centre that suggested that Nandi be taken to Hisar for orthopaedic surgery; sadly it was forced out of the hospital even before we could manage to get an appointment with the hospital.</p>
