				Farmed animals are every bit as intelligent and capable of feeling pain as the dogs and cats we cherish as our companions. They are inquisitive, interesting individuals who value their lives, solve problems, experience fear and pain and are capable of using tools.
				Yet the billions of animals killed for food every year have little legal protection from cruelty that would be illegal if it were inflicted on companion dogs or cats. They are neglected, mutilated, genetically manipulated, put on drug regimens that cause chronic pain and crippling deformities, transported through all weather extremes and killed in gruesome and violent ways. Going vegetarian is the best way to stop these atrocities.

				Going vegan helps keep the Earth healthy too. A recent United Nations report concluded that a global shift toward a vegetarian diet is necessary to combat the worst effects of climate change. Senior UN Food and Agriculture Organization official Henning Steinfeld reported that the meat industry is “one of the most significant contributors to today’s most serious environmental problems”.

				Humans have used leather, wool and fur for years and billions of animals are brutally slaughtered each year for the clothing industry. Mass production of fur and leather items has created a cruel system of farming, trapping, and skinning and, has sparked uproar among animal rights activists.We should push for better measures to protect animal rights and discourage animal experimentation. Remember that at every instance we have the choice to stop the cruelty by choosing other fabrics instead of leather, wool or fur, and buying cosmetics which have not been tested on animals. It’s not too late to protect animals. So, join our cause and stand up for the welfare of animals.

	ANIMALS FOR EXPERIMENTATION
</h2>

	<tr>

				The harmful use of animals in experiments is not only cruel but also often ineffective. Animals do not get many of the human diseases that people do, such as major types of heart disease, many types of cancer, HIV, Parkinson’s disease, or schizophrenia.  Instead, signs of these diseases are artificially induced  in animals in laboratories in an attempt to mimic the  human disease. Yet, such experiments belittle the complexity of human conditions which are affected by wide-ranging variables such as genetics, socio-economic factors, deeply-rooted psychological issues and different personal experiences.

					Animal testing should be eliminated because it violates animals' rights, it causes pain and suffering to the experimental animals, and other means of testing product toxicity are available. Humans cannot justify making life better for themselves by randomly torturing and executing thousands of animals per year to perform laboratory experiments or to test products. Animals should be treated with respect and dignity, and this right to decent treatment is not upheld when animals are exploited for selfish human gain. After all, humans are animals too.

				Industries that use animals as a source of entertainment try hard to keep cruelty hidden beneath the surface. There is no money in showing people the truth. They want the crowd to be dazzled without thinking too deeply about how or why the animals are acting a certain way. When animals are exploited for human profit, cruelty is never far behind.

					Animals are not given adequate time to exercise or roam as they would in the wild. Tigers, for example, have an instinctual need to roam and hunt, so being kept in captivity and forced to jump through flaming hoops alters their psyche. This is why accidents happen in circuses, zoos, and other forms of animal-based entertainment. These wild animals can only suppress their instincts for so long before a human gets hurt.
